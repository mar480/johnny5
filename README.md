A basic speech to text engine

The aim here was:

1. Actually write a programme start to finish, no tutorials etc. in an afternoon!
2. Focus on workflow elements - get it on GitHub and feel more confident about Git from the command line
3. Use a speech recognition library to create an always listening buddy with the voice of Johnny 5 who can crack jokes
  3a. i.e. using a module I've not used before, understand what is in the module, how the module works
  3b. incorporate basic Python (e.g. if/else statements, pass lists of files for random selection) to perform actions using the module
  3c. Write a short list of how this programme could be improved:
      1. Understand the os module! V. confused about filepaths
      2. DRY this code... seems like a fair bit of repetition in terms of if a.__contains__ which can probs be shortened down using some variation of variables and/or os module
      3. Can it respond faster than it currently does (perhaps by shortening the duration of the adjustment for ambient noise)?
      4. Can it respond more intelligently?//Can I incorporate a text to speech module that would allow it to talk back using user defined variables (e.g. What is your name? My name is XXX. Hi XXX!)?
4. Share on reddit - I've never done that before!
